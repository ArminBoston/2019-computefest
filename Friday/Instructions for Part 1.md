# Instructions for Part 1 of this workshop

Due to the pace of the workshop, and time taken in processing text files, during the workshop I will be executing code on the screen while students can read the code alongside.

All the material to play with the code is already uploaded and can be used by you after the workshop to run the code in your own time. This would require some setup, and as everyone uses different systems, we are refraining from executing code in the workshop.
