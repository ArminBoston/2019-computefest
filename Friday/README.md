#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Please download and install GLoVE embeddings - http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip. Particularly unzip the 100B file into your local directory by creating a folder called embeddings and then datasets inside that and placing it there. Effectively it will be my base directory\embeddings\dataset\glove.6B.100d.txt


More material will be posted after the workshop. Thank you!
