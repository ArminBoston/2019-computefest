### Harvard ComputeFest 2019

#### Actionable Understanding of Customer Reviews via Classification and Summarization

 - Pavlos Protopapas, WeiWei Pan, Spandan Madan, Srivatsan Srinivasan
 
#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Please download and install GLoVE embeddings - http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip. Particularly unzip the 100B file into your local directory by creating a folder called embeddings and then datasets inside that and placing it there. Effectively it will be my base (should be \2019-computefest\Friday) directory\embeddings\dataset\glove.6B.100d.txt

2. The complete dataset for reviews can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?fbclid=IwAR1IDqdxTDLMFOX1dZxd26sUpeoAx0XOIMDupaP_DMRekdr4yRsFZP6Q2AM . If you are training the model on your own machine, please use this dataset in its whole and train for reasonable results.


More material will be posted after the workshop. Thank you!
